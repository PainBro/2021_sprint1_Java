# Overview

A repository for my first attempt at a Java program. Done between January 11th and 23d of 2021.

This Java program is my first attempt at using the Java language. For 2 weeks I learned and implimented Java to create a simple program to recieve the data for a card from the trading card game Magic the Gathering. It then takes those cards and stores their data in a file.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

For this project I used the Java language through Visual Studio Code, to write and test.

# Useful Websites

* [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/java/)
* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)

# Future Work

* I need to add a way to take the cards stored in a file as inputs for looking at through the program.
* I would like to add a way to choose the file name, and whether the user would like to save the cards to a file.
* I want to make a more user friendly enviroment.
* I have to add a way to edit already input cards.
